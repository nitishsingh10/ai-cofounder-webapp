# Founding AI

**Agentic AI for Business Creation**

Founding AI is an advanced agentic AI web application that turns one natural-language command into a complete startup plan and business blueprint. It replaces the traditional chat or form-based interface with a "Command Center" experience where a team of autonomous AI agents collaborates, debates, and executes to build real business artifacts.

## Core Idea

The product is not a chatbot, a dashboard, or a report generator. It is an **execution environment** where the user issues a high-level command, and a coordinated system of AI agents executes it. The user observes the intelligence at work rather than micromanaging the process.

## User Experience Flow

The experience follows a linear, four-stage journey:

1.  **Landing**: Minimalist introduction to the concept.
2.  **Command**: The user provides a single, high-level instruction (e.g., "Build a high-end bakery in Bellandur").
3.  **Execution**: The user observes the "Execution Mode" where agents work visibly in real-time.
4.  **Outcome**: The system delivers a complete, stabilized business blueprint and a deployed website.

## Interaction Model

The application moves away from tabs and chat bubbles in favor of a time-based and artifact-based model:

*   **Left Column: Intelligence Timeline**
    *   Displays the *reasoning and coordination* layer.
    *   A vertical, time-ordered sequence of decision events.
    *   Shows agent actions, revisions, and approvals (e.g., "Strategy Agent defines concept", "Finance Agent flags risk").

*   **Right Column: Artifact Canvas**
    *   Displays the *outcomes and deliverables*.
    *   A living workspace where business artifacts (plans, models, designs) are built and updated in real-time.
    *   Artifacts stabilize once the agent team reaches a consensus.

## AI System Concept

The system simulates a team of specialized agents led by an Orchestrator. These are logical roles that define the behavior of the system:

*   **Intent Analyzer**: Extracts constraints and parameters from the user's command.
*   **Orchestrator**: Plans the execution order and manages dependencies.
*   **Strategy Agent**: Defines business concept, positioning, and target audience.
*   **Operations Agent**: Plans workflows, supply chains, and staffing.
*   **Finance Agent**: Validates unit economics and ensures viability (can block progress).
*   **Design Agent**: Creates brand identity and visual assets.
*   **Marketing Agent**: Develops launch and growth strategies.
*   **Tech Agent**: Generates code and deploys the business website.
*   **Synthesis Agent**: Assembles the final blueprint.

**Key Definition**: Agents can disagree and request revisions. The timeline reflects this rigorous process, distinguishing it from a simple linear generator.

## Design Principles

The design language is intended to feel "quietly powerful"—calm, serious, and intelligent.

*   **Tone**: Calm, Confident, Serious.
*   **Visuals**: Warm off-white backgrounds, minimal chrome, near-black text, and subtle motion (120-200ms fades).
*   **Anti-Patterns**: No chat bubbles, no heavy dashboards, no gamification, no unnecessary marketing fluff.
